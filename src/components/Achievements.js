                    Legacy initiative was started this year itself at Convocation. The idea was to raise funding from our graduating batch to help the upcoming batches, particularly for the development of more co-working spaces inside the campus. The initiative was a grand success and we were able to raise a substantial amount of money. The initiative was appreciated by the faculty and the students alike and we hope to continue this tradition in the coming years.
